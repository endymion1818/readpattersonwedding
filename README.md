# readpattersonwedding
My final custom-built PHP website, made for my Dad's wedding.

The aim was to provide some basic information for attendees of the wedding, location info, and a few words from the hosts. I also had the idea that people could share images they took and posted on social media, that would then also show up on the site. I used a jQuery plugin to achieve this. Facebook and Twitter worked fine but the vagaries of the Instagram API got me in the end.
